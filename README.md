#  Jurisdiction Selector for Vlex by David Salguero  

As provided in the exercise, I have created a JurisdictionSelector component, taking the data from the `fakeJurisdictionApi.js` specified in the email.  

I have used [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) for the styling because I think is a good option for styling fast projects like this without overcomplicated CSS files.  

The base react app was created with create-react-app.  

If you want to run the application, clone this repository and use command `npm start` to run the application. You will find it in http://localhost:3000
